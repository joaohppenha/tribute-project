<p> American comic books are a form of visual storytelling originating in the United States, combining text and illustrations. They became culturally significant during the Golden Age in the 1930s and 1940s, introducing legendary superheroes like Superman and Batman. Over time, the medium evolved to include a wide range of genres beyond superheroes. These comics have influenced global pop culture through films, television, and merchandise.</p>

Soon after, Marvel Comics revolutionized the genre by introducing more relatable and emotionally complex heroes like Spider-Man, the Fantastic Four, and the X-Men. This period embraced science fiction themes, evolving storytelling, and growing social awareness. The Silver Age laid the groundwork for the modern comic book universe, blending entertainment with deeper narratives.

  <h3>Trivia</h3>
  <p>
<strong>Fantastic Four #1</strong>, published by Marvel Comics in 1961, is widely considered the comic that truly launched the Marvel Universe.  
    Created by <em>Stan Lee</em> and <em>Jack Kirby</em>, it introduced a more human, flawed type of superhero, shifting the tone of comics during the Silver Age.  
    Unlike traditional heroes, the Fantastic Four argued, made mistakes, and dealt with real-life problems — a groundbreaking move that reshaped the genre.  
    This issue marked Marvel’s major entry into the superhero revival and helped define the Silver Age's shift toward more complex storytelling.

<h1> The Bronze Age </h1>
<p>
The Bronze Age of Comics (early 1970s to mid-1980s) marked a shift toward more mature and socially conscious storytelling. Publishers began addressing real-world issues such as racism, drug abuse, and political corruption. While maintaining superhero traditions, characters became more complex and morally ambiguous. Artistic styles evolved, and creators gained more recognition and influence. This era bridged the optimism of the Silver Age with the darker tones of the Modern Age. The Bronze Age also saw the rise of anti-heroes and the return of horror, fantasy, and supernatural genres. Independent publishers began gaining ground, challenging the dominance of Marvel and DC with fresh voices and diverse narratives.
